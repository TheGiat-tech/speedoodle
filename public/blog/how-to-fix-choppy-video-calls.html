    <p>Video calls freeze when your network cannot deliver packets consistently. Instead of swapping platforms or blaming the webcam, walk through a repeatable process that quantifies the issue and narrows it down to the home network, office Wi-Fi, or service provider.</p>
    <p class="cta">Before troubleshooting, <a href="https://www.speedoodle.com/">check ping, jitter &amp; upload</a> so you know what you are fixing.</p>
    <section class="tldr">
      <h2 class="tldr-title">TL;DR</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Capture three Speedoodle runs to confirm whether upload or latency is the bottleneck.</li>
        <li>Stutters usually come from Wi-Fi interference, saturated uplinks, or background sync tools.</li>
        <li>Permanent fixes mix Ethernet, QoS, and ISP escalation backed by Speedoodle evidence.</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>What is video call stability and why it matters</h2>
    <p>Choppy calls feel like slow internet, but the real culprit is packet delivery variance. Bandwidth governs how much data you can push, latency determines responsiveness, and jitter measures inconsistency between packets. Video platforms such as Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams all adapt quality on the fly, yet once upload dips under 3 Mbps or jitter exceeds 20 ms the apps run out of safety nets.</p>
    <p>Frequent buffering hurts sales demos, disrupts telehealth appointments, and erodes trust during executive presentations. When you quantify performance in Speedoodle you can separate user perception (“the call froze”) from network facts (“upload dropped to 1.2 Mbps when OneDrive started syncing”).</p>
    <p>Need a deeper bandwidth primer first? Jump over to our <a href="/blog/how-much-bandwidth-zoom.html">Zoom bandwidth guide</a> and return with specific thresholds in mind.</p>
    <h2>How to measure video call quality (ping, jitter, and upload included)</h2>
    <p>Close unnecessary tabs and open Speedoodle. Let the test run until it reports download, upload, ping, and jitter. Repeat the process on Wi-Fi and then on Ethernet so you can compare conditions. If you support distributed teammates, ask them to run the same test and email the CSV export.</p>
    <p>Log each run with three details: connection type, background activity, and perceived call quality. When you align subjective feedback with Speedoodle telemetry, patterns emerge—maybe the laptop on 5 GHz Wi-Fi struggles only when the microwave is in use, or maybe jitter spikes anytime the VPN tunnel is active.</p>
    <p>Keep a copy of the results while following the <a href="/blog/understanding-packet-loss-video-meetings.html">packet loss troubleshooting steps</a>. Packet loss and jitter often rise together, so addressing one usually benefits the other.</p>
    <h2>How to fix or improve video call stability</h2>
    <p>Move from quick isolation to permanent improvements with the checklist below. Work through each item and re-run Speedoodle afterward to confirm progress.</p>
    <ul class="checklist">
      <li>Plug laptops into Ethernet or a USB-C dock with wired backhaul.</li>
      <li>Reboot modems and routers to clear memory and stalled processes.</li>
      <li>Change DNS to 1.1.1.1 or 8.8.8.8 if name lookups feel sluggish.</li>
      <li>Enable Quality of Service for conferencing traffic so uploads stay prioritized.</li>
      <li>Close backup utilities, sync clients, and cloud recording software during calls.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you need to stay on Wi-Fi, reposition access points away from microwaves and cordless phones, split 2.4 GHz IoT devices onto a guest network, and assign static channels instead of “auto” in congested apartment buildings. Office networks may benefit from segmenting guest traffic on its own VLAN or enabling band steering so mission-critical devices use the less-crowded 5 GHz spectrum.</p>
    <p>When the Speedoodle log shows upload capping below your purchased tier, contact the ISP with timestamps and demand a line quality test. Escalate quicker if multiple neighbors on the same provider experience the same freeze patterns.</p>

      <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
      <article>
        <h3>What is an acceptable jitter for Zoom?</h3>
        <p>Under 30 ms is usable, but strive for less than 15 ms to keep HD calls stable. Anything higher signals that packets are arriving out of order or getting dropped.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>How much upload do I need for 1080p video?</h3>
        <p>Plan for 5 Mbps upload with another 20% reserved. Screen sharing or recording sessions can momentarily double usage, so the buffer prevents sudden drops.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>Ping vs bandwidth — which matters more?</h3>
        <p>Bandwidth keeps the picture sharp, but ping and jitter control responsiveness. Always investigate latency first; if ping is above 120 ms, resolve routing issues before upgrading to a faster plan.</p>
