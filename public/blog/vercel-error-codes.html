    <h1>Vercel Error Codes Explained</h1>

  </header>
  <main class="container article-body">
    <p>When deployments fail on Vercel, engineers scramble between logs, dashboards, and status pages. Understanding error codes up front shortens the path to recovery—especially for real-time products where latency and uptime are tied directly to revenue.</p>
    <p class="cta">Before redeploying, run a quick <a href="https://www.speedoodle.com/">internet speed test</a> to baseline ping, jitter, and throughput from your build location.</p>
    <section class="tldr">
      <h2 class="tldr-title">TL;DR</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Group Vercel errors into build, routing, function, and platform categories to triage faster.</li>
        <li>Use Speedoodle to confirm the issue isn’t network-related before escalating to Vercel support.</li>
        <li>Document fixes in runbooks so future incidents resolve in minutes instead of hours.</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>What are Vercel error codes and why they matter</h2>
    <p>Vercel categorizes issues into HTTP status families and internal identifiers. Build errors (such as <code>BUILD_FAILED</code>) stop deploys before they hit production. Runtime errors (<code>FUNCTION_TIMEOUT</code> or <code>FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED</code>) affect serverless functions. Routing errors (<code>NOT_FOUND</code>, <code>FAILED_DEPLOYMENT</code>) block users entirely. Treat each bucket differently: build errors need repository fixes, runtime errors need code or configuration tweaks, and routing errors often point to misconfigured rewrites or DNS.</p>
    <p>Because many Speedoodle customers host monitoring dashboards on Vercel, understanding these codes keeps quality-of-service metrics trustworthy. Real-time telemetry dashboards rely on consistent function execution; if an error lingers, latency reporting or webhook ingestion can stall.</p>
    <p>Need a refresher on optimizing performance once the deploy succeeds? Review the guidance in <a href="/blog/lowering-latency-hybrid-teams.html">our latency article for hybrid teams</a> to ensure the network path stays healthy.</p>
    <h2>How to measure impact (ping, jitter, and upload included)</h2>
    <p>Before declaring victory, validate the user experience. Run Speedoodle from the same region as your customers—especially if the incident involved edge functions or geolocation routing. Log ping, jitter, download, and upload so you can spot differences between pre-incident and post-fix conditions.</p>
    <p>Combine network metrics with Vercel’s request logs. For example, <code>FUNCTION_TIMEOUT</code> might be network-related if Speedoodle shows high latency at the same moment. If network metrics look clean, focus on function cold starts, unhandled promises, or third-party API delays.</p>
    <p>During regional incidents, ask teammates in other geographies to run the Speedoodle test too. Aggregate the CSV exports to confirm the fix is global, not just local to your workstation.</p>
    <h2>How to fix or improve reliability</h2>
    <p>Use the checklist below to shorten incident response and reduce repeats.</p>
    <ul class="checklist">
      <li>Switch to Ethernet on build agents when pushing emergency patches.</li>
      <li>Reboot CI runners or local dev machines to clear cached credentials.</li>
      <li>Update DNS and environment variables through Vercel’s dashboard before retrying.</li>
      <li>Enable Quality of Service or traffic shaping if deployments saturate upstream bandwidth.</li>
      <li>Close backup or large download tools so they do not throttle upload bandwidth.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For recurring build failures, cache dependencies smartly and monitor CI runtime against baseline numbers. For runtime errors, add logging around external API calls and use <code>await</code> responsibly so functions do not exit prematurely. Keep a shared runbook mapping each error to the owner, expected recovery steps, and relevant dashboards.</p>
    <p>If you suspect a Vercel-wide incident, capture Speedoodle metrics, screenshot the status page, and open a support ticket with reproduction steps. Precise data speeds up escalations.</p>

      <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
      <article>
        <h3>What is a good jitter for Zoom calls?</h3>
        <p>Under 15 ms keeps collaboration tools responsive. Even engineering standups benefit from stable jitter, so confirm your network before major releases.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>How much upload speed do I need for 1080p video?</h3>
        <p>Plan for at least 5 Mbps upload. Developers streaming coding sessions or pair-programming will appreciate the extra headroom.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>Is ping or bandwidth more important for gaming?</h3>
        <p>Ping drives responsiveness. When investigating Vercel incidents affecting real-time apps, watch ping and jitter alongside error logs to spot regional degradation.</p>
